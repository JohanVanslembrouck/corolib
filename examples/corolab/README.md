# corolab (coroutine laboratory)

Contains the examples I prepared for my presentation at the Belgian C++ Users Group on 29 January 2020.

Almost all files are self-contained: all coroutine functionality is implemented in the file itself.

These examples has not been changed since then. They served as the basis for developing corolib, hence the name corolab or coroutine laboratory.
