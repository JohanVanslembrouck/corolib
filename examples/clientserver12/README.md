# Client-server application using Qt

This folder contains a graphical version of the tcpclient1 application from folder clientserver11.
The tcpclient01gui application uses tcpserver01 from clientserver11 as server application.

The tcpclient01gui application first connects with the tcpserver01.
The user can then start any of the 5 measurement loop functions by clicking on the 5 push buttons.
By pressing the button a second time, the user stops the running measurement loop function.
