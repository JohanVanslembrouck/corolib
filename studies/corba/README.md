# CORBA client example

This study contains several variants of an CORBA operation invocation:

* synchronous invocation
* asynchronous invocation using callback
* asynchronous invocation using polling
* coroutine invocation, including the use of when_all and when_any

The reader is referred to ../../docs/CORBA-AMI.md for more background information.

The build process produces 1 executable, corba_client_app(.exe). Just run it from the command line.
